# GLSL Shader Playground

This repository contains a collection of shaders written in GLSL, aimed at improving shader development skills. The project leverages the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) and can be executed in WebGL/OpenGL contexts.
It includes basic operations and manipulations with images, such as pixel color operations and transformations in the UV space. Key features include various GLSL shaders demonstrating fundamental techniques, pixel color manipulations to create different effects, and UV space transformations to achieve unique visual results. Feel free to explore and contribute to this collection to enhance your shader development skills.
I will keep on adding new cool fragment shader stuff to it.
